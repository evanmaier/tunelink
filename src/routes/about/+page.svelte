		<h2>What is TuneLink</h2>
		<p>
			TuneLink is a sharing economy platform for musicians, think AirBNB but for music gear. Maybe
			you're traveling and want to pick up a guitar for a week, or perhaps you need an amp for a
			show tomorrow. Maybe you just want to try that new pedal before you buy it for yourself.
			TuneLink allows you to rent directly from other musicians, at a lower cost than music stores.
		</p>
		<h2>How it works</h2>
		<p>
			There are two ways to use the application. Either as a renter, or as a owner/lender. all users
			can do both.
		</p>
		<h3>Renting</h3>
		<p>
			First, you can search by keyword or browse the local instruments selection to find what you
			need. Next you send a rental request by navigating to the item page and clicking the request
			rental buttonm, then filling out the form. To do this, you need to have an account set up with
			a username, email, and password. Once the request is sent, you can track it's status on the
			rentals page. You can also chat with the owner to arrange pickup and payment.
		</p>
		<h3>Lending</h3>
		<p>
			Users can add an instrument by navigating to the add instrument page and filling out the form.
			Once uploaded, you can edit the details using the your instruments page. Once this is
			complete, other users can see their listing and send rental requests. If you receive a rental
			request, it will show up in the pending section on the rentals page. You can accept or reject
			this rental, and chat with the renter. Once the request is accepted, It moves to the accepted
			section. When the renter collects the instrument, you can activate the rental, which marks
			your instrument as unavailable to other users. Finally, when the instrument is returned, you
			can mark the rental as complete which.
		</p>
		<h2>Buisiness model</h2>
		<p>
			Currently this project is in alpha testing, the goal of which is to collect feedback and find
			bugs. Once I feel like the product is ready, we will add a free tier and paid tier. The plan
			is to allow users/buisinesses to list a small number of instruments for free, and charge a
			monthly fee for more listings. Our target customers are music stores with rental programs and
			a small online presence, and local musicians with lots of gear.
